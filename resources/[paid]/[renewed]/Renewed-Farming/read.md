How to use.

Admins can create farm plots by doing /createfarm, using these farm plots players can grow unlimited amount of foods, simply use the seed of their choice and place it in the bed.
After they're done planting they can head over to the farmers market where they can sell their crops for a profit, the farmer will also resell the product for a higher price.
